The topic of my presentation is about the space of streetlights between each other on a specific land road. My question is: Do the streetlights on that specific road have the obligated 50–100-meter space between each other.  The Idea was to look, whether or not the municipality complies with the legally stipulated distance of the streetlamps on this country road.
The Region that is displayed on the map is a town in the Seeland called Büren a. Aare (BE) with the focus on the land road called Aarenweg which is the road that I was observation. I gathered my data from a walk I did on that specific land road, where I mapped every streetlight on the way until I came to a bigger land road. Since these streetlights are on the side of the road, they are easily mappable, the data is very detailed and 100% complete. In ArcGis I created a buffer around every mapped streetlight with a radius of 100 meter so that I could see if the streetlights are in the legally stipulated distance between each other. When observing, you need to account that I have systematically mapped every Streetlight on that land road.
My map shows streetlights (pinpoints on fig.1) with a buffer radius (yellow) of 150 Meter. At the start there are 8 Streetlights in a row which is a lot. But as you look further there isn’t any Streetlight in over a kilometre. Even though it’s a land road at least every 30 sec a car drives on this road this shows that its very dangerous for joggers and children to walk along this road when its dark. Additionally, there is a Football pitch 200 metres after the last Streetlight which makes it even more dangerous because large groups of children use this road to go to training and when they are finished its dark.
The suggestion for this map ( green pins ) is located in front of the Football pitch. There one more streetlight should be added because of the kids that are going home back from training. The other one is located by the “Fischerhüsli” because it’s a sort of a Camping place and if there are peoples going over the street they can’t be seen.
